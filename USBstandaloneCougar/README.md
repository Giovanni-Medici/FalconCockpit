This folder contains the files for the USBstandaloneCougar project. In particular in the Arduino folder you will find two .ino files. Only one file is needed depending on your preference:

### EASY mode : No modification at all to your Arduino / Teensy configuration files : CougarStandalone_V11_TeensyJoystick.ino

### DIFFICOULT mode : You really can't stand Cougar to appear as Serial/Keyboard/Mouse/Joystick, you are happy modifying a ton of configuration files : CougarStandalone_V11.ino
